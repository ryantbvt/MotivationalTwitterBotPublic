# MotivationalTwitterBot
 
Twitter Bot made during the MLH Local Hack Day Hackathon

If someone tweeted at my twitter bot, it'll reply with a motivational quote.
Added features of this bot was a community command where people can add quotes to the bot
and then people can call another command to view a random quote that the community has contributed
